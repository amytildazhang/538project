538 model for Senate forecasts (with notes on  how to adjust for Presidential

Ask about:
- perceived effect of sample size on accuracy
- LOESS 
- 

1. Weighted polling average
	- discard polls know/suspect have faked results or have other gross ethical mixsconduct
	- discard internal polls conducted directly on behalf of candidates or party organizations
	- Weighted on recency, sample size, pollster rating
		- half-life of a poll in days is 14 + 0.2 * daysuntil, daysuntil = number of days until the election
		- Question: what is "expected effect" on accuracy of increasing sample size?
		- sample size weighting is asymmetric--penalized more for small sample size
		- will do pollster rating myself/talk about it if there is time/room
2. Adjustments to polling average
	- Likely Voter adjustment
		- registered voter polls usually overrate democrats
		- 538 model defaults to shifting polls of RV toward Republicans by 2.7 percentage points (historical average difference)
	- House Effects adjustment (usually least important)
		- some polling firms have a tendency to consistently show more favorable results for one or the other party
		- != bias --refers to how a poll compares against other polls of the same race, while bias refers to how it compares against actual results
		- REGRESSION on all Senate and generic congressional ballot polls
			- dummy variable for each state and each polling firm.Coefficient associated with dummy variable for each polling firm is a reflection of house effect
			- calculated after likely voter and trend line adjustments are applied--theoretically pollster won't have house effect just because it surveys a different sample population or surveys the race at a different time
			- also includes a "buffer zone" so that it doesn't ruin the point of aggregating polls together
				- based on number of polls a pollster has released
				- it is the 90% confidence interval associated with model's estimate of each firm's house effect
				- remove any house effect beyond the buffer zone from the poll--e.g. a firm with a buffer of 2pp and a 5pp Republican house effect will have its results adjusted toward Democrats by 3 points
				- also applies house effects adjustment to account for the fact that some polling firms consistently show more undecided voters
			- minor thing--house effects from past years used to help calibrate the house effects adjustment
				- they are treated as one-tenth as important as polls from current year
			- how to calculate baseline? 
				- use weighted average, weight is based on number of polls a firm has released and its pollster rating
				- also excludes firms that do not call cellphones

	- Trend line adjustment
		- important in presidential, not so much in Senate
		- make accurate inferences about how polls are changing in one state based on other states
		1. All polls placed into groups based on week of election and the state-pollster unit (interaction term b/w pollster and state)
			- Weeks are defined as seven days before current date, and so on
			- treat national polls as a "state"
			- do not include national polls directly in averages -- they provide robust baseline for measuring changes in candidate support, so they are used to infer trends
		2. Linear REGRESSION with one dummy variable for each week, oen for each state-pollster interaction. Coefficients of weekly dummy variables give idea of time trend
		3. Smooth time trend using a LOESS regression-use a fairly conservative smoothing parameter for a smoother curve
			- 0.85 LOESS?
		4. Polls from previous weeks are adjusted to match the LOESS estimate from the current week
			- make old data match the current polling landscape
			- LOESS regression tells us taht average poll in current week has been 2.5pt stronger for Obama than some other week. That other week, the state0pollster sai
3. State fundamentals
	- long discussion on importance of determining uncertainty in a forecast
	- use the fact that same two candidates are on ballot in each state to make comparisons from one state to the next
	- prevents abrupt shifts in forecast based on recent strong polling in a certain state
	- REGRESSION on
		- national polls (indicates overall partison mood)
		- approval ratings (for races with incumbent Prez; interaction b/w approval ratings and president)
		- fundraising totals: proportion raised by each major-party candidate, e.g. Dem has $3M, R has $1M, D has 75%. Only looks at sum of individual public contributions
		- http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do
		- highest elected office held
			3 points for current/former gov/sen
			2 points for HoR
			1 point for nontrivial elected offices
			0 for no substantive position
		- dummy variable for incumbency. Should have a negative coefficient (incumbents usually raaise more money, so negative coefficient compensates)
		- margin of victory in past election
			- adjusted relative to national climate in re-election year, using aggregate popular vote
		- candidate ideology, state partisanship
			- DWNominate scores 
				- Obama: -0.343
				  https://voteviewblog.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/an-update-on-the-presidential-square-wave-july-2015/
				 - Romney: 
			- CFscores
			- OntheIssues.org scores
			http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-senate-races-with-the-biggest-ideological-stakes/
			- Normalize the three scores so each has same average and standard deviation
			- ideology of voters: presidential results relative to national average, winners of recent past congressional races in the state, using average dW-Nominate score over past four Congresses
4. Now-cast/snapshot
	- adjusted polling average in Step 2 and state fundamentals estimate in Step 3 are combined into a single number that projects what would happen in an election today
	- state fundamentals estimate is equivalent to a poll with a weight of 0.35 (a really badly-rated poll) but THIS IS FOR SENATE. For presidential, the weight is larger (0.60, based on http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/methodology/)
	- ins tates with abundant polling, state fundamentals tend to be a small percentage of the weight
5. Election Day forecast
	- more uncertainty
	- projection of national popular vote based on economic index
		- can think of as the "national fundamentals"
	-http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/measuring-the-effect-of-the-economy-on-elections/
	- stock market has weight of 0.10, other 6 have 0.15
	- calculate one-month, two-month, to one-year change in these variables, average together after normalizing to have same standard deviation
		- stock market does this, but for all 252 trading days
		- stock market uses close of s&p on most recent trading day
	- weight placed on national fundamentals decline over course of campaign, until 0 by election day
	- assumes that incumbent's results revert toward mean of how past incumbents had performed
6. Estimate margin of error
	- look at which factors are historically correlated with larger errors
	- regression on all races, where dependent variable is absolute value of difference b/w model's forecast outcome and actual result
	- factors:
		- days until election. positively ocrrelate
		- number of polls. negatively correlated.
		- disagreement between polls. negatively correlated.
		- disagreement b/w polling average and state fundamentals. negatively correlated.
		- number of undecideds or third-party voters. positively corelated
		- lopsided race (i.e. one candidate is up by a lot). positively correlated.
7. Simulate outcomes and estiamte the probability of each candidate winning
	- 538 uses FLeishman's transformation
	- why?
		- error in polls is not independent from state to state
	- model breaks error into two subcomponents: national error and state-specific error using a sum of square formula
		- national error: overall bias of 538 forecasts
		- in each simulation, program draws a series of random numbers. 1st is national error, then rest or numbers for each state
		- numbers are added together to produce simulated result in each state
		- estimate candidate's chance of winning and number of seats each party will control
		- model vote-shares for third-party candidates on log-normal distribution
		- use ideology scores to account for bote-sharing b/w third party and one of the main parties
		- count number of seats won in each simulation
